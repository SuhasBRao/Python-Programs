    "You are given a list of values as set form and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have the following set of numbers: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, and we need to find the nearest value to the number 9. If we sort this set in the ascending order, then to the left of number 9 will be number 7 and to the right - will be number 10. But 10 is closer than 7, which means that the correct answer is 10.\n",
